# 🧠 Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal Machine Learning portfolio, where I showcase a variety of projects covering the three core areas of machine learning:

- 🔵 **Supervised Learning**
- 🟢 **Unsupervised Learning**
- 🟠 **Reinforcement Learning**

Each project is built with real datasets and demonstrates both the technical implementation and insights derived from the models.

📂 Feel free to explore the code, replicate the experiments, and extend the ideas for your own learning or applications. All repositories are open and well-documented to help others understand the thought process behind each solution.

🚀 New projects are added regularly as I continue learning and experimenting.

Check out individual folders for detailed READMEs and project-specific documentation.

## 🔍 Data Sources
All datasets used in this portfolio are publicly available and sourced from platforms such as Kaggle, academic datasets, or open data repositories. I do not claim ownership of the datasets.
